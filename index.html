                        <hr class="mb-5">
                        <p class="mb-5" style="text-align:justify">There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I would like to express myself that what I see, what I experience what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking, and honest. Hello, My name is Aysha Nazeer, I was born in 1999 and I'm from Sri Lanka, which is a small island, simply known as the pearl of the Indian Ocean. I'm currently living in Kandy which is located in the central province of Sri Lanka. I started my schooling at Gampola International School and for higher studies, I joined K/Azhar college and completed my studies over there.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Nobody comes into this world, without the support of family and friends. Whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. As I come from a middle-class family my father is a respectable businessman in our community, my mother is a housewife and she is the most innocent and kind-hearted person I've ever known. I have learned many things from my parents which will be more useful to my life as the value of time, honesty, hard work, commitment to the purpose and always to speak the truth never to lie as it is said in my religion. As I'm the last child of my family, I have an elder sister who's married and blessed with two cute children, with whom I used to spend most of my time.‚ù§ I love spending time with my friends because I forget all my problems whenever I'm with them, and they are my happy pills‚ù§. I love eating food whenever I'm in a good mood or a bad mood and especially brownies are my favorite. This is my circle of the world.ü•∞ </p> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Reading is my leisure pursuit, I'm a keen reader of novels and motivational books. I love learning new things which will be more helpful to improvise my knowledge. In 2019, I did my final exams, during my exams I was a confused and useless kid because was sickened by dengue fever. I had not done well in my final exams at school ‚òπÔ∏è and had consequently lost the opportunity to study in a government university, I was looking for something interesting to do.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">I always had a knack for information technology, specifically in computer coding and programming. Due to low results in my final exams, I tried many external ways to join a government university to complete any courses regarding information technology, but due to some issues, I left my plannings for studies and started new a career as a teacher in an International school. After 6 months of teaching, I resigned from my job, started focusing on my studies again, and trying to complete all the objectives which flow in my path to reach my goals. üí™üí™ I have faced many problems in life and all my problems made me stronger than everüí™!</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of women. No women can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life. Without good career planning, right from the start, one can‚Äôt be on the right track. One has to set the goals under his or her broad career goals.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">These are all the things which express me. "Though" nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind!</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Spread love‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§</p>
